A number of studies have demonstrated that exercise can be used as an adjuvant to the immune system. Using a human vaccination model, it was found that exercise may augment immune-competence and enhance vaccine responses.Such improvement may lead to a direct reduction in rates of rates of infection-associated hospital visits, infection-related deaths and infection-induced inflammation leading to MM tumour relapse.",

In healthy people, muscles often undergo large active and passive changes in length during daily activities. However after stroke there is an 80% reduction in use of the affected arm at the large joints (shoulder, elbow and wrist joints) compared to the unaffected arm during daily activities. The thumb and finger joints of the affected arm may not undergo sufficient, large amplitude movements to maintain normal passive muscle length and stiffness.\n\nSome limitations in previous studies that use accelerometers to map physical activity are (1) accelerometer measures taken at the wrist cannot quantify the amount of thumb and finger joint motion and (2) accelerometers cannot quantify amplitude of thumb and finger movement. This study proposes to apply modern stretch sensor technology to measure amount and amplitude of thumb and finger joint range of motion over a prolonged period after acute stroke. \n",

        "researchquestion": "Specifically the project asks the following research questions:  \nWhat practice knowledge do psychiatrists communicate to others?  \nWho do psychiatrists communicate this knowledge to?  \nThrough what forums does this communication take place?  \nWhat practice knowledge do psychiatrists gain from others?  \nWho do they gather their practice knowledge from? \nHow does practice innovation from elsewhere become integrated into an individual psychiatrist’s practice?  \nAre current official and non-official channels set up for sharing innovation and practice knowledge effective?  \nTo what extent do individual psychiatrists alter their practice in response to official recommendations in their own and other jurisdictions (e.g. HCCC recommendations)?",
        "aimsbackground": "This project explores a significant gap in our understanding of the functioning of Australian mental health systems: how individual psychiatrists communicate with and learn from others working in mental health. Within this context the research is specifically focussing on the communication of practice innovation. Innovation has become a policy goal as reflected in the establishment of the NSW state government’s Agency for Clinical Innovation and is seen as a goal for individual practitioners (NSW Health, 2009). However the extent to which this is possible given the systemic and practice constraints placed on practitioners is not fully understood. The project therefore takes as a starting point how practitioners, and specifically psychiatrists, communicate with others within the mental health system. Understanding channels of communication is vital if we are to understand how the transmission of innovation is to take place within the mental health system. The first aim of the study is thus to explore the channels through which psychiatrists communicate with each other and with others working within the mental health system. The second aim is to understand what type of knowledge psychiatrists communicate with others. The third aim is to understand the structural and communicative barriers to effective communication and learning for innovation. The project will explore these issues in the context of the NSW health system and utilise an online survey and in-depth interviews administered to individual psychiatrists.",
        "method": "Survey and interviews: A short, secure (utilising SSL technology), online survey will be distributed to psychiatrists working in selected areas across NSW. The target areas will be the Sydney greater metropolitan area (including Blue Mountains), Broken Hill and Coffs Harbour. These sites have been chosen as they represent metropolitan, regional and remote areas. Potential respondents will be contacted via an email sent out by local health networks (in the case of psychiatrists working in the public sector) and via professional bodies such as the ANZRCP or the association for Rural Psychiatry.  Interviews will be semi-structured interviews. Interviews will explore the research questions in more depth in order to tease out the subtle complexities of psychiatrists’ communicative relationships. The aim is to conduct 20 interviews of half an hour in length. Interview responses will be professionally transcribed. Data will be entered into the qualitative data management software NVivo and hand coded according to the research questions. A preliminary report will be distributed to all respondents and relevant organisations and through established practitioner, academic, health and policy networks.",

A secondary aim of this project is to investigate the relationship between muscle strength, muscle power, function and quality of life in persons with CMT.",

CMT causes slow degeneration of the nerves in the extremities resulting in weakness including feet, legs, arms and hands. In the past, persons with CMT have been discouraged from performing exercise and physical activity because clinicians believed that such activity might hasten the disease; these beliefs have never been validated by studies or evidence. Evidence is required on exercise for persons with CMT, especially at moderate to high intensities. A considerable amount of weakness and muscle atrophy seen in persons with CMT is very likely due to secondary disuse due to inactivity. Exercise training might counteract some of the weakness and also provide persons with CMT \"protection\" from developing secondary metabolic disease or lead to improve functional ability in daily activities.

Measures of health, fitness and quality of life will be taken before and after training.The results of this pilot study will be promoted to educate persons with CMT and clinicians on the benefits of exercise for CMT.",

These stimulation angle will be compared to a biomechanical model which predicts the optimal angles to use. \n2) Optimization of muscle stimulation window. The stimulation window which produces the most drive over one pedal revolution may not be the optimal angle to use over longer period of cycling, for example during the Cybathlon FES bicycle race. It is likely that there is a trade off between the stimulation angles and fatigue, i.e. longer stimulation angles will produce more fatigue and less cycling power in the longer term. To determine the relationship between stimulation angle and muscle fatigue, experiments will be performed on the Biodex Testing System 2.\nThe results of these two experiments will be used maximise the performance of the Sydney University Team attending Cybathlon.",

This raised IOP causes the progressive death of the output neurons (nerve cells) of the eye called retinal ganglion cells. Despite substantial research on this disease, the pathophysiology of glaucoma is not fully understood. The aim of this project is to understand the pathophysiological changes in the properties of ganglion cells in glaucoma. ",

We will examine the properties of ganglion cells at different time points to allow comparisons before the development of glaucoma and during glaucoma with peak IOP. The properties of ganglion cells will be characterised by doing electrical recordings using patch clamp techniques and confocal microscopy. We will focus our studies on the large alpha ganglion cells. We will characterise their basic physiological responses, which provide information about their health and behaviour such as spontaneous activity, contrast sensitivity and receptive field organisation. Thus, this project will contribute to our understanding of the effects of raised IOP characteristic of glaucoma on ganglion cell properties that ultimately leads to their death. ",

        "aimsbackground": "Aiming to reduce breast cancer deaths, the Australian breast-screening program has targeted 50-69 year old Australian women since 1991 for biennial screening mammograms [2]. However, exposing healthy women to ionising radiation can add to the risk of inducing breast cancer. Therefore the dose to the breast must be kept as low as reasonably achievable [3]. Hence the introduction of Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRLs) provides a measure of quality control and optimisation to limit variation in dose among and within imaging centres; these levels are expected not to be exceeded for a standard diagnostic procedure when good and normal practice is applied. The International Commission of Radiation Protection defines DRLs as:\n“A form of investigation level, applied to an easily measured quantity, usually the absorbed dose in air, or tissue-equivalent material, at the surface of a simple phantom or a representative patient.” [3]\nThe measurements of radiation dose to the breast have been performed using different approaches including total energy transmitted to the breast [4], mid-breast dose [5], air kerma [6], entrance surface dose [7], and the average dose absorbed by the glandular tissue [8]. The latter is now assumed to be the most effective quantity to reflect absorbed dose by the breast because the glandular tissue of the breast is most sensitive to ionising radiation [8].\nMean glandular dose (MGD), is now the recommended metric by several authorities such as the International Commission of Radiation Protection (ICRP) [9], the United States National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements [10], the British Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) [11], the European Council Protocol (EP) [12-14], and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) [15]. MGD cannot be directly measured during an x-ray examination but can be estimated with certain standard assumptions and is calculated from conversions factors that have been established using Monte-Carlo techniques [16-26]; the estimation of MGD can be achieved using either a standard phantom or a representative patient.\n\nMean glandular dose estimates the  dose to the patient's breast based on the for mer that assumes the breast is 50%  glandular.  This method has been used for many years and has been very successful. However, modern automatic volumetric methods of breast density assessment are becoming increasingly common. The recent TOMMY  trial in the UK compared the volumetric assessment of 2 systems Quattra  and Volpara.  this trial demonstrated that the actual grounds latte of the breast is much lower than is assumed  in the mean glandular dose calculation. The Quattra method of assessment estimated the mean glandularity of the breast in the UK was 9.5% ranging from 1.4 to 56.2. The other method of assessment estimated the average as 7.7% ranging from 2.5 to 54.2. As that can be seen from these actual measures of  glandularity  using a mean of 50%,  is hopelessly inaccurate.  The proposed work is groundbreaking, and uses the most advanced tools, combined with \"big data\" to calculate the most accurate measure of radiation risk for women undergoing mammography and you are in the world.",
        "method": " Data has been collected for the mean glandular dose of women in Australia. A sample of these images will  have their actual granularity measured. Using this actual  glandularity a new action of glandular dose will be calculated. \n\nThe 1st stage of calculating this will be to measure the glandularirty on the image. Several tools are available for doing this, student will use the most advanced software available at the time the project, most likely \"auto density\" or Volpara.  this number will then be substituted into the calculation for mean glandular dose and an actual glandular dose estimated.\n\nThis dose will then be calculated for a range of compressed breast thicknesses to give a realistic measure of the real radiation risk for women undergoing mammography in Australia.",

However, while National Stroke Foundation audits indicate that this training is completed for the majority of people post stroke, the audit is very simple (Yes, No based on file progress entry)  and it is not clear what is offered for family and health professionals and whether what is implemented IS based on evidence (e.g., dosage, core content, materials, theory etc). It is also possible that training programs 'on the ground' are not strongly evidenced based because the research evidence does not match their clinical needs and population.  Knowing about what clinicians have developed for their populations might also lead to new partner training programs that could be trialled for the efficacy AND also be more suitable for the stroke unit environment (and therefore actually used!).",

        "aimsbackground": "Communication partner training (CPT) is an evidenced-based treatment for people with aphasia post stroke, in traumatic brain injury and dementia. CPT is important because family and health professionals need help to converse with and meet clients health needs. One reason is that family members and professionals change the way they talk with loved ones and clients including over simplified language, patronising tone of voice, not giving the person enough time to talk, not valuing their opinion. These types of communication interactions generally make the client feel bad or disempowered and the family and health professionals find the interaction unrewarding/less successful. \n\nWhile each CPT targets a different population (stroke, TBI, dementia), not all services see such distinctive division in their clients who may present with more than one, or the clients may occupy a ward where health professionals need efficient training options that cover a range of areas rather than extensive programs for one aetiology. Some communication partner training programs for TBI last for a total of 30 hours, while some aphasia programs, a day, and a dementia program, 45 minutes. While it is possible that some elements of CPT need to cover distinct aspects of the individual disorders, there may be significant overlap in content if we assume that there may be a unifying theoretical understanding of  how partners ‘accommodate’ (overcompensate) their loved one/client. We need to understand the nature of the theoretical underpinnings of published research across these different populations and consider the common and different elements across the studies. We may then be able to compare this with more broad-based theories of accommodation to allow a common  set of training principles along with smaller population specific elements, allowing for more efficient training potentially saving the health system dollars/resources.\n",

Work status impacts upon the quality of life of an individual and has economic impacts for the wider community. Hence, returning to work and maintaining employment are a major focus of brain injury rehabilitation programs. Successful participation in vocational activities may be affected by cognitive communication impairments arising from TBI, including impairments in verbal reasoning and executive functioning, memory, attention and speed of thinking. These impairments may underpin the difficulties people with TBI experience in meeting the communication demands of work settings. Yet the complex relationship between verbal reasoning, cognitive abilities and work outcomes are not fully understood.\nThe Functional Assessment of Verbal Reasoning and Executive Strategies (FAVRES) is an ecologically based assessment tool that requires individuals to reason through every-day problem situations (MacDonald & Johnson, 2005). The aim of this project is to understand how performance on the FAVRES underlies work outcomes 2 years after TBI.\nThis project will explore the relationship between verbal reasoning (assessed with the FAVRES), cognitive skills (assessed with neuropsychological tasks) and reported work outcomes. \n",

        "aimsbackground": "eHealth is a growing area of practice and research. The term e-Health describes the use of information communication technology (ICT) in the delivery and management of healthcare services. It includes, but is not limited to, the delivery of health services (for example, remote healthcare delivery), monitoring of health conditions via telehealth tools/applications and online health education and treatment. Another critical application is the management of patient information through personally controlled electronic health records (PCEHR) and routinely collected health system data. At present, there is no evidence-based interdisciplinary eHealth service delivery model. This may be due, in part, to the variable adoption of eHealth by health professionals. Research has found that OTs working in rural and remote NSW do not use telehealth for delivery of services to their clients with disabilities1 despite the fact that clients and carers are willing to try accessing services via technology2.  In addition, a survey of 10,000 members of the Australian Nursing Federation found that fewer than 25% of nurses were very confident in using technology3.  A 2011 Commonwealth Government report on “The eHealth Readiness of Australia’s Allied Health Sector”4 concluded that:\n\n“most allied health practitioners see the potential benefits of eHealth to their practice and health outcomes, and can and will use well-designed solutions.... Self-contained administrative, research, professional education and note viewing applications are already being widely used. However, when considering more networked, care-focused solutions, most practitioners see the potential costs and barriers currently outweighing the benefits”. \n\nIn this project, we aim to provide insight into the barriers and facilitators of interdisciplinary eHealth use and develop an evidence-based model of interdisciplinary, patient-centred care. To achieve this, we will: \n1.\tExplore what health professionals perceive to be the barriers and facilitators to engaging in interdisciplinary eHealth.  \n2.\tInvestigate the data systems and types of data collected by interdisciplinary health professionals. \n\nReferences:\n1.\tChedid, R., Dew, A., Veitch, C.

An earlier study by Korenromp, Page-Christiaens, van de Bout, Mulder, and Visser (2007) explored the decisions of women who had terminated their pregnancy due to Down syndrome and found that 63% of women (N=71) reported that they did not want a disabled child. 83% of women held a belief that having a child with Down syndrome would be a burden for the prospective child and 73% worried about the burden on the their other children with 64% considering the burden on themselves (Korenromp et al., 2007)\n\nConversely, a number of studies report on the positive impact on the family of having a child with Down Syndrome (King, Batorowicz, & Shepherd, 2008; Lalvani, 2011; Taunt & Hastings, 2002) \n",

        "aimsbackground": "The 45 and Up and the  Social Economic Environmental  Factors study (SEEF) are questionnaire-based studies with large sample sizes (n>200,000 & n>60,000 respectively) and  great potential for answering research questions on sedentary behaviour, standing  and sleeping.  The corresponding self-administered survey items enquire about daily times spent on sitting, sleeping, standing, TV/computer   combined (45 & Up only), TV (SEEF only),  and computer use  (SEEF only). Although several published and ongoing studies have used these time allocation data, none of these questions have been validated.       The Actigraph is probably the most widely used accelerometer in physical activity research. The recent GT3X+ triaxial model is being marketed as an inclinometer but preliminary testing suggests that when worn on the usual placement spot (waist) its performance in determining postural allocation is poor.  On the other hand, ActivPAL  is a specialised inclinometer used broadly in  sedentary behaviour research ,although is very expensive for large scale research and requires adherence directly on the thigh skin, which may make it problematic in certain situations.  The Actigraph is limited as a device for measuring sedentary behaviour because its inclinometer has been found to have poor accuracy for determining posture allocation when worn on the waist. Less is known regarding its accuracy when worn on the thigh, a location used to differentiate between sitting and standing with the ActivPAL.

The evidence supporting this hypothesis is weak.  The proposed research project will examine whether bouts of physical activity (upper end of moderate intensity and vigorous intensity) moderate any effects that prolonged sitting has on markers of cardio-metabolic health. This project consists of a number of sub-projects and will look at different age groups (young adults, middle age adults and older adults).  The focus will be primarily on metabolic outcomes, such as post-prandial glucose and insulin, but several hemodynamic, haemostatic and lipid-related outcomes that are linked to  prolonged sitting and physical activity will also be examined.

Although the effect of physical activity on liver function  remains unclear, high levels of habitual physical activity have been shown to be associated with a reduced incidence of  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and short-term exercise interventions have proven to be effective in lowering liver fat levels. On the other hand, moderate consumption of alcohol is considered beneficial for cardiovascular health but high alcohol consumption is linked to poor cardiovascular health and increased risk for various severe liver disorders including alcoholic liver disease,   liver cirrhosis, and alcoholic hepatitis. Recent longitudinal epidemiological studies suggest that among those who have high levels of physical activity and high cardiorespiratory fitness, alcohol intake is not associated with increased risk for cardiovascular mortality. These observational studies imply that regular exercise may, to some extent, protect against the health risks associated with alcohol drinking, although there a paucity of studies in controlled settings.

The specific objectives are to examine the effects of first-time dog adoption on key cardiovascular and metabolic  health markers, physical activity and sedentary behaviour,  stress,  positive affect among middle to old age sedentary individuals.\n\nIn 2013 the American Heart Association published a Scientific Statement on the cardiovascular health benefits of pet ownership. Although the statement is generally positive about the potential of dog ownership to improve cardiovascular health of humans (lower blood pressure and  stress levels, better recovery after heart attacks, etc)  it also highlights important limitations of existing research, such as:  \n•        Most studies are of moderate to low quality and there is a lack of  randomized controlled trials \n•        It is very unclear how dog ownership may benefit human healthy, is it e.g.  through increased physical activity, or through psychological health benefits (companion, stress release, etc) \n•         Dog ownership is   linked to higher daily physical activity (walking) compared to non-owners  but most studies have not adequately controlled for factors other than dog ownership that may explain this difference in physical activity. Also, existing studies have focused on disease-related outcomes and there is a paucity of studies looking at whether owning a dog can improve positive affect.   Several other important human health-related aspects of dog ownership have not been examined, including the possible mediating role of socialisation with other owners while walking the pet, and whether dog ownership reduces indoor sedentary behaviour as well as increasing outdoor physical activity.   \r\n\r\nThis research project is done in collaboration with RSPCA New South Wales. There will be   opportunities for the student to input on the study design and contents.  Research will divided into two phases: Phase 1 - piloting:  a small-scale randomized trial to examine the feasibility of the participant recruitment mechanism and all research methods that will be used in Phase 2. \r\n \r\n\r\nPhase 2 – Randomised Controlled Trial:     \r\nGroup 1: deferred dog adoption ( waiting list for 6 months);  Group 2:    deferred dog adoption (waiting list) and enrolment in a supported walking program; Group 3: imminent dog  adoption\r\n\r\nKey skills and competencies that will be developed during this PhD: trials, cardiometabolic  biomarkers, stress-related biomarkers, positive affect and mental health evaluations,  objective physical activity and sedentary behaviour   monitoring\r\n",

The term e-Health describes the use of information communication technology (ICT) in the delivery and management of healthcare services. It includes, but is not limited to, the delivery of health services (for example, remote healthcare delivery), monitoring of health conditions via telehealth tools/applications and online health education and treatment. Another critical application is the management of patient information through personally controlled electronic health records (PCEHR) and routinely collected health system data. At present, there is no evidence-based interdisciplinary eHealth service delivery model. This may be due, in part, to the variable adoption of eHealth by health professionals. Research has found that OTs working in rural and remote NSW do not use telehealth for delivery of services to their clients with disabilities1 despite the fact that clients and carers are willing to try accessing services via technology2.  In addition, a survey of 10,000 members of the Australian Nursing Federation found that fewer than 25% of nurses were very confident in using technology3.  A 2011 Commonwealth Government report on “The eHealth Readiness of Australia’s Allied Health Sector”4 concluded that:\n\n“most allied health practitioners see the potential benefits of eHealth to their practice and health outcomes, and can and will use well-designed solutions.... Self-contained administrative, research, professional education and note viewing applications are already being widely used. However, when considering more networked, care-focused solutions, most practitioners see the potential costs and barriers currently outweighing the benefits”. \n\nIn this project, we aim to provide insight into the barriers and facilitators of interdisciplinary eHealth use and develop an evidence-based model of interdisciplinary, patient-centred care. To achieve this, we will: \n1.    Explore what health professionals perceive to be the barriers and facilitators to engaging in interdisciplinary eHealth.  \n2.    Investigate if there is a difference between rural and metro health professionals in their perceived barriers and facilitators to engaging in interdisciplinary eHealth. \n\nReferences:\n1.

Children with phonological difficulties can also have concomitant expressive language impairment. Research on whether intervention targeting one domain can have cross effects on an untreated domain are equivocal, with some research supporting cross-over domain generalization (e.g., Tyler, Lewis, Haskill, Tolbert, 2002) and other research not providing support (e.g., Fey et al., 1994). \n\nThe purpose of this study will be to determine if input-based phonological intervention targeting consonant cluster difficulties in children, indirectly improves expressive morphosyntax. \n\nFor further reading: \n(1) Fey, M.
