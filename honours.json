A number of studies have demonstrated that exercise can be used as an adjuvant to the immune system. Using a human vaccination model, it was found that exercise may augment immune-competence and enhance vaccine responses.Such improvement may lead to a direct reduction in rates of rates of infection-associated hospital visits, infection-related deaths and infection-induced inflammation leading to MM tumour relapse.",

In healthy people, muscles often undergo large active and passive changes in length during daily activities. However after stroke there is an 80% reduction in use of the affected arm at the large joints (shoulder, elbow and wrist joints) compared to the unaffected arm during daily activities. The thumb and finger joints of the affected arm may not undergo sufficient, large amplitude movements to maintain normal passive muscle length and stiffness.\n\nSome limitations in previous studies that use accelerometers to map physical activity are (1) accelerometer measures taken at the wrist cannot quantify the amount of thumb and finger joint motion and (2) accelerometers cannot quantify amplitude of thumb and finger movement. This study proposes to apply modern stretch sensor technology to measure amount and amplitude of thumb and finger joint range of motion over a prolonged period after acute stroke. \n",
        "method": "Customised stretch sensors will be positioned over the extensor surface of the index finger and thumb. Data will be collected from 15 participants with stroke and 15 able-bodied control participants. These data will be recorded by a wireless device.",

        "aimsbackground": "This project explores a significant gap in our understanding of the functioning of Australian mental health systems: how individual psychiatrists communicate with and learn from others working in mental health. Within this context the research is specifically focussing on the communication of practice innovation. Innovation has become a policy goal as reflected in the establishment of the NSW state government’s Agency for Clinical Innovation and is seen as a goal for individual practitioners (NSW Health, 2009). However the extent to which this is possible given the systemic and practice constraints placed on practitioners is not fully understood. The project therefore takes as a starting point how practitioners, and specifically psychiatrists, communicate with others within the mental health system. Understanding channels of communication is vital if we are to understand how the transmission of innovation is to take place within the mental health system. The first aim of the study is thus to explore the channels through which psychiatrists communicate with each other and with others working within the mental health system. The second aim is to understand what type of knowledge psychiatrists communicate with others. The third aim is to understand the structural and communicative barriers to effective communication and learning for innovation. The project will explore these issues in the context of the NSW health system and utilise an online survey and in-depth interviews administered to individual psychiatrists.",
        "method": "Survey and interviews: A short, secure (utilising SSL technology), online survey will be distributed to psychiatrists working in selected areas across NSW. The target areas will be the Sydney greater metropolitan area (including Blue Mountains), Broken Hill and Coffs Harbour. These sites have been chosen as they represent metropolitan, regional and remote areas. Potential respondents will be contacted via an email sent out by local health networks (in the case of psychiatrists working in the public sector) and via professional bodies such as the ANZRCP or the association for Rural Psychiatry.  Interviews will be semi-structured interviews. Interviews will explore the research questions in more depth in order to tease out the subtle complexities of psychiatrists’ communicative relationships. The aim is to conduct 20 interviews of half an hour in length. Interview responses will be professionally transcribed. Data will be entered into the qualitative data management software NVivo and hand coded according to the research questions. A preliminary report will be distributed to all respondents and relevant organisations and through established practitioner, academic, health and policy networks.",

CMT causes slow degeneration of the nerves in the extremities resulting in weakness including feet, legs, arms and hands. In the past, persons with CMT have been discouraged from performing exercise and physical activity because clinicians believed that such activity might hasten the disease; these beliefs have never been validated by studies or evidence. Evidence is required on exercise for persons with CMT, especially at moderate to high intensities. A considerable amount of weakness and muscle atrophy seen in persons with CMT is very likely due to secondary disuse due to inactivity. Exercise training might counteract some of the weakness and also provide persons with CMT \"protection\" from developing secondary metabolic disease or lead to improve functional ability in daily activities.

        "aimsbackground": "The aim of this project is to improve our understanding of electrical stimulation so that both recreational and competitive electrical stimulation cycling can be improved. In October 2016, pilots with paralyzed leg due to complete spinal cord injuries (SCI) will compete in the Cybathlon bicycle race. The Cybathlon is an Olympics for where persons with disability utilise assistive technology to compete. The University of Sydney team attended a rehearsal event in Zurich in July 2015. Although, the University's cyclist performed well it was clear that with better training, understanding of electrically stimulated muscle fatigue and more appropriately timed muscle stimulation the cyclist could have performed better.",
        "method": "The proposed research will be composed of two parts and use persons with paraplegia from our laboratory:\n1) Optimization of muscle stimulation angles to produce more drive on the pedal crank. This part of the project will involve systematically modifying the muscle stimulation for each muscle to determine which angles produce the greatest power drive on the pedal crank. These stimulation angle will be compared to a biomechanical model which predicts the optimal angles to use. \n2) Optimization of muscle stimulation window. The stimulation window which produces the most drive over one pedal revolution may not be the optimal angle to use over longer period of cycling, for example during the Cybathlon FES bicycle race. It is likely that there is a trade off between the stimulation angles and fatigue, i.e. longer stimulation angles will produce more fatigue and less cycling power in the longer term. To determine the relationship between stimulation angle and muscle fatigue, experiments will be performed on the Biodex Testing System 2.\nThe results of these two experiments will be used maximise the performance of the Sydney University Team attending Cybathlon.",

Despite substantial research on this disease, the pathophysiology of glaucoma is not fully understood. The aim of this project is to understand the pathophysiological changes in the properties of ganglion cells in glaucoma. ",

We will examine the properties of ganglion cells at different time points to allow comparisons before the development of glaucoma and during glaucoma with peak IOP. The properties of ganglion cells will be characterised by doing electrical recordings using patch clamp techniques and confocal microscopy. We will focus our studies on the large alpha ganglion cells. We will characterise their basic physiological responses, which provide information about their health and behaviour such as spontaneous activity, contrast sensitivity and receptive field organisation. Thus, this project will contribute to our understanding of the effects of raised IOP characteristic of glaucoma on ganglion cell properties that ultimately leads to their death. ",

        "aimsbackground": "Aiming to reduce breast cancer deaths, the Australian breast-screening program has targeted 50-69 year old Australian women since 1991 for biennial screening mammograms [2]. However, exposing healthy women to ionising radiation can add to the risk of inducing breast cancer. Therefore the dose to the breast must be kept as low as reasonably achievable [3]. Hence the introduction of Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRLs) provides a measure of quality control and optimisation to limit variation in dose among and within imaging centres; these levels are expected not to be exceeded for a standard diagnostic procedure when good and normal practice is applied. The International Commission of Radiation Protection defines DRLs as:\n“A form of investigation level, applied to an easily measured quantity, usually the absorbed dose in air, or tissue-equivalent material, at the surface of a simple phantom or a representative patient.” [3]\nThe measurements of radiation dose to the breast have been performed using different approaches including total energy transmitted to the breast [4], mid-breast dose [5], air kerma [6], entrance surface dose [7], and the average dose absorbed by the glandular tissue [8]. The latter is now assumed to be the most effective quantity to reflect absorbed dose by the breast because the glandular tissue of the breast is most sensitive to ionising radiation [8].\nMean glandular dose (MGD), is now the recommended metric by several authorities such as the International Commission of Radiation Protection (ICRP) [9], the United States National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements [10], the British Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) [11], the European Council Protocol (EP) [12-14], and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) [15]. MGD cannot be directly measured during an x-ray examination but can be estimated with certain standard assumptions and is calculated from conversions factors that have been established using Monte-Carlo techniques [16-26]; the estimation of MGD can be achieved using either a standard phantom or a representative patient.\n\nMean glandular dose estimates the  dose to the patient's breast based on the for mer that assumes the breast is 50%  glandular.  This method has been used for many years and has been very successful. However, modern automatic volumetric methods of breast density assessment are becoming increasingly common. The recent TOMMY  trial in the UK compared the volumetric assessment of 2 systems Quattra  and Volpara.  this trial demonstrated that the actual grounds latte of the breast is much lower than is assumed  in the mean glandular dose calculation. The Quattra method of assessment estimated the mean glandularity of the breast in the UK was 9.5% ranging from 1.4 to 56.2. The other method of assessment estimated the average as 7.7% ranging from 2.5 to 54.2. As that can be seen from these actual measures of  glandularity  using a mean of 50%,  is hopelessly inaccurate.  The proposed work is groundbreaking, and uses the most advanced tools, combined with \"big data\" to calculate the most accurate measure of radiation risk for women undergoing mammography and you are in the world.",
        "method": " Data has been collected for the mean glandular dose of women in Australia. A sample of these images will  have their actual granularity measured. Using this actual  glandularity a new action of glandular dose will be calculated. \n\nThe 1st stage of calculating this will be to measure the glandularirty on the image. Several tools are available for doing this, student will use the most advanced software available at the time the project, most likely \"auto density\" or Volpara.  this number will then be substituted into the calculation for mean glandular dose and an actual glandular dose estimated.\n\nThis dose will then be calculated for a range of compressed breast thicknesses to give a realistic measure of the real radiation risk for women undergoing mammography in Australia.",

In 2012 there were 23,934 physiotherapists registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) and of these 17,890 were working as clinicians (1).  A large proportion (42%) of clinical physiotherapists work in private practice in Australia (1) and this figure was estimated to be even higher at 53.5% and between 2.9 and 7.8 times that of chiropractors and osteopaths respectively (2).\nThe Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health (BEACH) study has been publishing reports on activity in general practice since 1998.  The BEACH reports have provided powerful evidence of the uptake of best practices in general practice and have been used to inform policy in general practice.  In 2012 it was estimated from private health insurance claims, that physiotherapists provide an average of 796 services per registered practitioner (2).  There is very little research to describe the case mix of patients treated by physiotherapists in private practice.

The chiropractor study had a response rate of 33% (4), to ensure a final sample of 100 physiotherapists invitations will be sent to 350 physiotherapists.  Each physiotherapist will be asked to complete the Morbidity and Treatment Survey for 100 patient encounters.\nDescriptive statistics will be used to summarise the physiotherapist, patient and encounter characteristics.  Reasons for encounter will be reported by ICPC chapter and physiotherapist identified problems and diagnoses reported by ICPC-2 PLUS terms.  For each therapist we will identify those patients attending more than once during the 100 encounters.  Estimates of the recorded encounters and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.  Physiotherapist characteristics will be compared with available national data.\n",
