These approaches overlap, with the behavioural approach being primarily directed at the structures and processes underlying movement without considering their physical basis, while the neurophysiological approach is primarily directed at the neuromuscular machinery and the functional neural connections that govern movement. The information processing and energetic capacities that underpin motor performance are examined; such as memory,  attention,  decision-making, movement planning, speed-accuracy trade-off, force control, economy of energy, coordination, multi-task performance, automaticity, lateralisation, sense of effort and resources, as well as expert-novice skill differences. The features of learning that can be manipulated to promote motor learning are also examined, such as learner motivation, methods of instruction, practice and modelling conditions, and types of instructional feedback. The applications to teaching motor skills, coaching and rehabilitation are considered. Finally, and across the unit, ecological and motor program theoretical approaches to motor control learning are integrated. Students will read relevant research and theoretical material and be expected to report and interpret their findings and contribute to class discussion.",

        "description": "Molecular imaging in vivo has revolutionised the field of nanomedicine. Central to this field is the ability to label, track and target specific cells and tissue in vivo. This is achieved by utilising the various molecular imaging modalities available to the clinician. In the pre-clinical sense, this includes computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), optical imaging (i.e. luminescence and fluorescence) and ultrasound. All of these modalities have specific advantages that can be translated into a suitable pre-clinical analysis (e.g. MRI provides exquisite spatial resolution while PET has extremely sensitive detection limits). These techniques can then be utilised to give different information regarding cell-labelling, tracking and targeting. The development of various cell labelling/targeting technologies can involve receptor binding motifs (e.g. antibodies, antibody fragments, peptides, aptamers, small molecules) that are directly attached to the imaging modality, or can be a part of a larger construct (e.g. nanomaterials). In this way, the various requirements for cell-labelling are incorporated into the one construct (e.g. receptor binding for uptake or attachment to cells, molecular imaging agent for tracking). This course will describe the various approaches used for cell-labelling and tissue targeting in vivo, including methods for preparation of chelates and conjugates required for each imaging modality. Particular emphasis will be placed on the complementary nature of each modality.",

Topics covered include the radioactive tracer principle, radioisotope production and decay, radiation transport in tissue, radiation detection, PET and SPECT instrumentation, tomographic reconstruction and an introduction to tracer kinetic modelling. On completion of this unit, students will have a thorough understanding of the imaging chain as it relates to PET and SPECT, starting with the emission of radiation in the body, leading to its external detection and, finally, a reconstructed image of the radioactive tracer distribution in the body. The factors affecting the accuracy and noise properties of molecular images will be explored. Students will also have an appreciation of how to use these imaging technologies to exploit the properties of the radioactive tracer principle and make estimates of important physiological parameters.",

        "description": "Molecular imaging in vivo has revolutionised the field of nanomedicine. Central to this field is the ability to label, track and target specific cells and tissue in vivo. This is achieved by utilising the various molecular imaging modalities available to the clinician. In the pre-clinical sense, this includes computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), optical imaging (i.e. luminescence and fluorescence) and ultrasound. All of these modalities have specific advantages that can be translated into a suitable pre-clinical analysis (e.g. MRI provides exquisite spatial resolution while PET has extremely sensitive detection limits). These techniques can then be utilised to give different information regarding cell-labelling, tracking and targeting. The development of various cell labelling/targeting technologies can involve receptor binding motifs (e.g. antibodies, antibody fragments, peptides, aptamers, small molecules) that are directly attached to the imaging modality, or can be a part of a larger construct (e.g. nanomaterials). In this way, the various requirements for cell-labelling are incorporated into the one construct (e.g. receptor binding for uptake or attachment to cells, molecular imaging agent for tracking). This course will describe the various approaches used for cell-labelling and tissue targeting in vivo, including methods for preparation of chelates and conjugates required for each imaging modality. Particular emphasis will be placed on the complementary nature of each modality.",

The physiology component will introduce students to mechanisms underlying signal generation and neural transmission, mechanisms of spinal reflexes, the function of the somatosensory and autonomic nervous system and motor pathways. Tutorials will consist of case studies aimed at identifying simple neural problems associated with sensory and motor systems and are specifically designed for students following professional preparation degrees. This unit includes a few laboratory classes in which human cadavers are studied; attendance at such classes is strongly encouraged.",

Students will learn about the concepts and philosophies that underpin occupational therapy professional practice (including models of practice based on sociological, psychological and biological theories), specifically the nature of human occupations and the analysis of occupations.  They will also apply this to the occupational therapy process and principles of practice to link with observation of practice in the field.  As part of the fieldwork experience students will develop an understanding of the occupational therapy process and develop practical skills in communication, interaction and professional behaviour under supervision. Students will also engage in self reflection to identify their personal learning needs, existing strengths and required capabilities of occupational therapists.",

It is concerned with identifying how internal determinants (characteristics unique to the person, and part of physical or psychological make-up) and external determinants (physical environment and social context) impact upon the individual. It is also concerned with the way in which people change over time, as well as explaining and predicting what they might do at any one time.

In addition students examine specific clinical and professional issues relating to the intensive care and acute care environment. The emphasis is on appropriate assessment, safe and effective management of intubated and non-intubated patients. The neurodegenerative conditions module examines the pathology, impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions arising from neurodegenerative conditions which require adaptation (such as Parkinsonism, multiple sclerosis, and motor neuron disease).  Students learn to assess and train or prescribe appropriate aids to enable activities such as rolling over, sitting, walking, transferring, wheelchair mobility and reaching and manipulating objects to be carried out.

The unit will also examine the use of technology as an extension of one's impaired body (e.g., brain-computer interface). Tutorial assessment includes in-depth analysis of a topic of your choice and running your own experiments. NB: This unit does not teach about standard treatments taught in the core units of professional courses.

Students will be required to report on the value and effectiveness of current harm minimisation practices; e.g., needle sharing programs, needle injecting facilities, methadone maintenance. Students will be asked to examine and report on the practical effectiveness and moral and ethical considerations surrounding the operation of such programs and possible alternatives. In the second half of the unit students will consider the effectiveness and community acceptance of the various established rehabilitation and treatment programs. This will include research into programs such as Alcoholic and Narcotic Anonymous, Therapeutic Communities, and the range of professionally-based therapeutic counselling approaches.
